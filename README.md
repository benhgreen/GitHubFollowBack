# GitHubFollowBack
Subscribe to automatically follow and be followed by other users!

My implementation of 'subscription groups' for GitHub. All users in a group automatically follow each other.

Features to implement:
* User-created groups
* Unsubscribing from specific groups

This app uses Flask and MongoDB. Pull requests to improve the front end are greatly appreciated.
